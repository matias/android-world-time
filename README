android-world-time: Yet another "World Time" app for Android.

2010-03-14

I wrote this, today, as my first Android app, to see how Android development,
was, and because I wanted something just like this. It's clearly not the only 
app in the market that does this.

android-world-time is a work in progress, expect bugs and ugly code.
Use at your own risk. No warranties expressed or implied, etc etc.

Requires google-collect-1.0.zip from http://code.google.com/p/google-collections/.
Built using Eclipse and the ADT plugin.
